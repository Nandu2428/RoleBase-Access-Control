TechStack: ReactJS, TailwindCSS

npx create-react-app rolebase   =>command for react application

Tailwind Installation:
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init  


Idea Of Project:
After executing the project login page will occur if we login through the admin Credetials the admin dashboard will open. 
Admin Credentials:
     username:Nandu
     Password:Nandu4321
If not an admin User will first register and login in to website. The Website will show stories for an user.
For admin there is a permission to remove and add and view the user and search for the user.

I had used Role Json-server for the backend.

To run the project npm start
